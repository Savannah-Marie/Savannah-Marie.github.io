# Do you like food?

If so, you should carry on reading... or looking as we can't think what to type so we're adding images instead. 

**Enjoy!**

## Breakfast

![French Toast](/img/Break2.jpg)

## Brunch

![Chorizo Hash](/img/Brunch1.jpg.webp)
![Acai bowl](/img/Brunch2.jpg)


You can add images using the below markdown syntax:

```
![Image alt text](/img/path.jpg)
```

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
